After downloading the files, we need to modify the file application.js which is
at the root of the project. This file contains an example of slides. When you
have done these as you wished, open the file index.html with your browser to
project your slides.

You can do a nice slider with using only two functions : <addSlide> and
<configure>

For this functions, you can use simplify tags which are already prepared (you
can modify some of them by changing the theme). The list of tags is :
+ center : align the text in the center				(basic system)
+ left : align the text at the left					(basic system)
+ right : align the text at the right				(basic system)
+ red : color the background in red					(theme-default)
+ blue : color the background in blue				(theme-default)
+ green : color the background in green				(theme-default)
+ purple : color the background in purple			(theme-default)
+ img : identify the value as an image				(basic-system)
+ youtube : identify the value as a youtube video	(basic-system)
+ clear : clean the vertical placement				(basic-system)

To use a list of tags, you need to write a string which is composed of some of
these tags. Example : "purple center clear"
Be careful, some tags can disappear if you change the theme.

	addSlide
	--------
	description :
	This function adds a slide and can only changes the characteristics of the
	current slide.

	parameters : 
	Some parameters are optional.

		Title
		type : <string> | null
		default value : null
		behaviour : if the value is null, the slide doesn't have a
		title. But if the value is a string, a title is added to
		the slide and has the string as content

		TitleStyle
		type : <list of tags> | "title_default_style"
		default value : "title_default_style"
		behaviour : if the value is "title_default_style", the list of tags
		defined in the function <configure> will be used for formatting the
		title. In the other cases, the title will be formatted with the tags
		defined in the list.

		Frame
		type : null | <string> | <array of string>
		default value : null
		behaviour : if the value is null, no frame will be placed in the slide.
		If the value is a string, one frame will be placed and its content will
		be this value. Finally if the value is an array of string, each element
		of the array will determinate a frame. 
		The string (or the array of string) can be formatted to obtain more
		features :
		+ A pattern of this match : {A,B} will be represented by a list in the
		  final slide.
		+ You can also directly put the path to a image in the string. The tag
		"img" given in the FrameStyle will generate the code to insert the
		target image.
		+ You can put the path to a youtube video. The tag "youtube" given in
		the FrameStyle will generate the code to insert the target video.


		FrameStyle
		type : "default_style" | <list of tags> | <array of <list of tags>>
		default value : "default_style"
		behaviour : if the value is "default_style", the list of tags defined
		in the function <configure> will be used for formatting the frame. If
		the value is a list of tags the frame will be formatted with the tags
		defined in the list. Finally, if the value is an array, each element
		determinate a frame defined by the parameter Frame. If the array of
		FrameStyle is smaller than Frame, the frames which don't have explicit
		styles will be formatted by the function <configure>.

		SlideStyle 
		type : "vertical" | "classic" | "first"
		default value : "classic"
		behaviour : With the value "vertical", the frames will be positioned
		vertically. But you can cancel this position by using the tag "clear".
		All frames defined after the frame which has the tag "clear" and this
		one too, will be placed horizontally under ones placed vertically. If
		the value is first, the title will be placed at the middle of the
		slide.  This configuration is often used for the first slide of a
		showing.  "classic" is ... the classic value.


	configure
	---------

	This function sets up the defaults values and global informations about the
	slides.

	parameters :
	Some parameters are optional.

		default value : "auto"

		will have a light color and else the font will have a dark color.

		FontSize
		type : "auto" | <SIZE px> | <SIZE em>
		default value : "auto"
		behaviour : If the value is auto, the theme will choose the adapted size
		of the font in the frames in function of the screen size. If you specify
		the size, the font in the frame will be fixed.

		FramesStyleDefault
		type : <list of tags> 
		default value : "none"
		behaviour : Determines the style of the frames which haven't been
		configured in the function addSlide.
			
		TitlesStyleDefault
