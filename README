The SmartSlider is a actionScript (javascript) and css plugin which permits to
generate simple and sexy slides by using only simple jquery functions.

Using
-----

After downloading the files, we need to modify the file application.js which is
at the root of the project. This file contains an example of slides. When you
have done these as you wished, open the file index.html to project your slides.

You can do a nice slider with using only two functions : <addSlide> and
<configure>

For this functions, you can use simplify tags which are already prepared (you
can modify some of them by changing the theme). The list of tags is :
+ center : align the text in the center
+ left : align the text at the left
+ right : align the text at the right
+ red : color the background in red
+ blue : color the background in blue
+ green : color the background in green
+ purple : color the background in purple
+ img : identify the value as an image
+ youtube : identify the value as a youtube video
+ clear : clean the vertical placement

To use a list of tags, you need to write a string which is composed of some of
these tags. Example : "purple center clear"

	addSlide
	--------
	description :
	This function adds a slide and can only changes the characteristics of the
	current slide.

	parameters : 
	Some parameters are optional.

		Title
		type : <string> | null
		default value : null
		behaviour : if the value is null, the slide doesn't have a
		title. But if the value is a string, a title is added to
		the slide and has the string as content

		TitleStyle
		type : <list of tags> | "title_default_style"
		default value : "title_default_style"
		behaviour : if the value is "title_default_style", the list of tags
		defined in the function <configure> will be used for formatting the
		title. In the other cases, the title will be formatted with the tags
		defined in the list.

		Frame
		type : null | <string> | <array of string>
		default value : null
		behaviour : if the value is null, no frame will be placed in the slide. If
		the value is a string, one frame will be placed and its content will be
		this value. Finally if the value is an array of string, each element of
		the array will determinate a frame.

		FrameStyle
		type : "default_style" | <list of tags> | <array of <list of tags>>
		default value : "default_style"
		behaviour : if the value is "default_style", the list of tags defined in
		the function <configure> will be used for formatting the frame. If the
		value is a list of tags the frame will be formatted with the tags
		defined in the list. Finally, if the value is an array, each element
		determinate a frame defined by the parameter Frame. If the array of
		FrameStyle is smaller than Frame, the frames which don't have explicit
		styles will be formatted by the function <configure>.

		SlideStyle 
		type : "vertical" | "classic" | "first"
		default value : "classic"
		behaviour : With the value "vertical", the frames will be positioned
		vertically. But you can cancel this position by using the tag "clear".
		All frames defined after the frame which has the tag "clear" and this
		one too, will be placed horizontally under ones placed vertically. If
		the value is first, the title will be placed at the middle of the slide.
		This configuration is often used for the first slide of a showing.
		"classic" is ... the classic value.


	configure

	This function sets up the defaults values and global informations about the
	slides.

	parameters :

		Resolution
		type : "auto" | <WIDTHxHEIGHT>
		default value : "auto"
		behaviour : Determinate the size of the showing in your browser. The
		value "auto" allows to the slide to maximize its size. A fixed value

		on video-projectors.

		FontColor
		type : "auto" | "light" | "dark"
		default value : "auto"
		behaviour : If the value is "auto", the color of the font will be
		automatically chosen by the theme. If the value is "light", the font
		will have a light color and else the font will have a dark color.

		default value : "auto"

		of the font in the frames in function of the screen size. If you specify
		the size, the font in the frame will be fixed.
