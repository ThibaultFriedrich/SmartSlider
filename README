After downloading the files, we need to modify the file application.js which is at
the root of the project.

This file contains an example of slides.

You can do a nice slider with using only two functions : <addSlide> and <configure>

For this functions, you can use simplify tags which are already prepared (you
can modify some of them by changing the theme). The list of tags is :
+ center : align the text in the center
+ left : align the text at the left
+ right : align the text at the right
+ red : color the background in red
+ blue : color the background in blue
+ green : color the background in green
+ purple : color the background in purple
+ img : identify the value as an image
+ youtube : identify the value as a youtube video
+ clear : clean the vertical placement
